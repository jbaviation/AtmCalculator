# Atmospheric Property Calculations
## Requirements (for running)
 - Java >=8 Update 151
 - Maven >=3.3.x

## Project Motivation and Details
Generated several years ago as a means to cross calculate various atmospheric properties. This project started in an attempt to recreate [this website](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/scripts/atmosphere/) in order to validate its calculations and have a way to preserve these methods if the website shut down.

Since the inception of this project, newer more accurate, effective, and efficient means of performing atmospheric property calculations have been discovered and are being utilized. Refer to the [atmos](https://github.com/jbaviation/atmos) repository built in Python and utilizes the [CoolProp](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp) library for improved accuracy.

Keep in mind that this repository is mostly for reference when certain calculations are to be called upon in the future. I do not maintain the ability for this project to be run, nor any updates to calculation methods.
